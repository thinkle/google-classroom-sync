## TODO

* Keep track of grades we've already created so we don't re-post
* Update UI so we can see we're posting grades

* Can we automate grade import so once we "link" we can
  automatically import grades going forward? (NOTE: this is potentially a security risk since we'd be running code on a schedule and we'd need a 
  way to authenticate the user -- so how would we know the code we run
  on a schedule has the right permissions etc.?)
* Failing that: maybe we just make an "update" Button that grabs all 
  linked assignments and updates grades accordingly.
* See if we can get contain-css to work with our current setup so we can 
  have a nice looking UI.
## Done

As of September 2024, we have:
* Grade and Assignment Creation is working
* Basic course mapping is functional
